orzlang is a """general purpose""" language designed by bored teenagers who went
to the Wolfram Summer Research Program. it allows individuals afflicted with the
contemporary illness known as *brainrot* to effectively express computation
while remaining irony-posioned. 

orzlang is better than Java, and if you paypal us 1,000,000 USD
we will make an orzlang to JVM bytecode compiler so you can put the most orz
language in your production codebase.

also, orzlang should be the official replacement for ECMAscript on the web 
because someone needs to put frontend devs out of their misery.
